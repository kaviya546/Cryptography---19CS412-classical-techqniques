# Caeser Cipher
Caeser Cipher using with different key values

# AIM:

To encrypt and decrypt the given message by using Ceaser Cipher encryption algorithm.


## DESIGN STEPS:

### Step 1:

Design of Caeser Cipher algorithnm 

### Step 2:

Implementation using C or pyhton code

### Step 3:

1.	In Ceaser Cipher each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
2.	For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
3.	The encryption can also be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers, according to the   
    scheme, A = 0, B = 1, Z = 25.
4.	Encryption of a letter x by a shift n can be described mathematically as,
                       En(x) = (x + n) mod26
5.	Decryption is performed similarly,
                       Dn (x)=(x - n) mod26


## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
int key;
char s[1000];
printf("Enter a plaintext to encrypt:\n");
fgets(s, sizeof(s), stdin);
printf("Enter key:\n");
scanf("%d", &key);
int n = strlen(s);
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
char c = s[i];
if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z')
{
s[i] = 'a' + (c - 'a' + key) % 26;
}
else if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')
{
s[i] = 'A' + (c - 'A' + key) % 26;
}
The program is executed successfully
}
printf("Encrypted message: %s\n", s);
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
char c = s[i];
if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z')
{
s[i] = 'a' + (c - 'a' - key + 26) % 26;
}
else if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')
{
s[i] = 'A' + (c - 'A' - key + 26) % 26;
}
}
printf("Decrypted message: %s\n", s);
return 0;
}
```
